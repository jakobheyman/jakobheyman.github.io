            Cosmogenic dating has become a key tool for paleoglaciology and there is a large (and growing) number of published cosmogenic ages from glacial landscapes. To enable reuse of these glacial samples, including recalculation with updated calculators and production rates, I have compiled a global dataset of <span class="supscript">10</span>Be and <span class="supscript">26</span>Al data from glacial samples. The compilation can be found here: <a href="http://expage.github.io/">expage.github.io</a>.</div>

            Using cosmogenic nuclide analysis of river sediments from the northeastern Tibetan Plateau we have been able to estimate the average erosion rate for river basins on the low-relief plateau surface, along the steep plateau margin, and in the glacially carved mountain valleys. The data will be used for evaluating the long-term landscape evolusion.</div>

            Many tors that were covered by the European and North American ice sheets have been dated with cosmogenic nuclide analysis to show the preservation potential under non-erosive ice. However, there are few tors (and tor-like surfaces) from areas never covered by ice that have been dated by cosmogenic nuclide analysis. This project adds some cosmogenic data for tors in the Bavarian Forest that have avoided ice coverage.</div>

            <div class="res1"><b>Paleoglaciology of the NE Tibetan Plateau</b><br>
            My PhD thesis (2005-2010) focussed on the glacial history of the presently ice-free Bayan Har mountains on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Based on the pattern of glacial landform (remote sensing) and glacial deposits (field investigations) we concluded that the mountains have been covered by extensive ice-fields at some point in the past, but extensive low-lying plateau regions also lack any evidence for past glaciation. With cosmogenic (<span class="supscript">10</span>Be) dating of glacial boulders, surface pebbles, and a few depth profiles we obtained a wide range of exposure ages ranging up to well above 100 ka. With scattered exposure ages we did not succeed in defining a precise glacial chronology, but the generally old exposure ages, including three old boulders on a moraine formed by a relatively small valley glacier, showed that the Bayan Har glaciers during the global last glacial maximum were not much larger than today.</div>
